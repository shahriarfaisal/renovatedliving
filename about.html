                            <p>I’m Kirk Burrows the owner of Renovated Living
                                A little bit on my background.  As a young man in my teens and during a 2 year break before pursuing higher education,  I worked for a construction company, a landscape design and construction group, as well as my own landscaping  business.  This was in the town of Fredericksburg, TX, and during this time I fortunate to be part of constructing everything from small storage buildings to large airplane hangars, and outdoor projects from simple planter beds to complete outdoor living areas.  
                           A project that stands out in my mind was a beautiful property that had just been purchased by James Avery.
                                 It was a few blocks off main street, and built in the late 1800’s. Since it was the first project I’d done on my own, subcontracting me to demo/salvage the two single story additions, one on each side of the original 2 story limestone home, must have been a real leap of faith for the contractor.  About 10 months later, coincidently, I had joined a local landscape company that was then hired to work on that same property.  The images stand out in my memory to this day. The original massive square cut limestone exterior, with the addition of a copper roof intentionally oxidized green.  Around the house Ivy covered pergolas and patios, multilevel planting beds, stone retaining walls, limestone stairs and walkways that wound through St. Augustine grass, all covered in shade from Pecan and Live Oak trees.  
                      
                         It would be hard to underestimate the pride I felt as a young man from being a part of such a spectacular renovation.</p>
                               <p>
                                As much enjoyment as I was having, a degree and working for a corporation was still the plan, and the key to success and happiness as I understood.  Fast forward a little bit, its now about 7 years after college, at which point I took on my first personal home improvement project.  Although I enjoyed my career, the experience of designing and building that deck reminded me of the satisfaction that comes from turning a vision into reality and a job well done.  For the next 13 years I kept the projects coming, both interior and exterior, for my own property as well as friends and family.  I found myself continually experimenting on projects of my own, and they grew in scope, size.  Renovating had become the biggest part of my waking thoughts and energy, and eventually I knew I had to make it, simply, what I do.
